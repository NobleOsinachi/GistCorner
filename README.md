### Rebranding

We've recently undergone a rebranding process. Thanks to the amazing [ Daily Tuition Tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3GF6endl8&ab_channel=DailyTuition), we were able to rebranded the website using Next JS 13 App Router and served blogs from serverless functions,following similar layout.
